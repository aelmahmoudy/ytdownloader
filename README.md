**INFO**

To be able to enjoy the 1080p or higher YouTube video resolutions, 
I added the Dashboard/FFmpeg feature to **MUX** a video-only and an 
audio-only dash streams into a complete video.

Instructions:
---
*(Please read carefully)* 

**To use the test feature**  

- enable the secondary (video-only and audio-only) streams into prefs;  
- go share a video to YTD (obviously);  
- click to download a desired **VO** stream *AND* an **AO** stream.

**After downloads completion**

- click on the VO video into the Dashboard;
- select *Add audio stream (already downloaded)*;
- [**note**: this will *not* work with AO/VO entry downloaded with previous YTD versions];
- follow instructions to download the latest FFmpeg build.

After the MUX a complete video should be available.
